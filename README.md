# Basic-blog
A basic fully-functional blogsite.

# Functionality:
A user can read all the blogs listed on the home page but, to add a new blog or a new comment to any blog, one has to login or sign in.
Users can also edit and delete his/her blog or comment when signed in.

# Installation:
1. Install mongoDB and npm (comes along with node.js).
2. Install all the packages listed in the package.json file under dependencies.
3. Once you have downloaded the code, ensure that all the file paths are correct or change them accordingly (especially while including the partials folder which contains the header and the footer files).
4. Run the mongo daemon executable on your terminal. Ensure that you are on the correct file path (command: ./mongod).
5. Open another tab on the terminal and enter the "node app.js" command which starts the server.
6. Go to your browser and type the url "localhost:3000". This should show the home page of the site.
